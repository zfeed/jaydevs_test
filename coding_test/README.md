Edit distance

The code in this project measures edit distance between two words:

_Given two words word1 and word2, calculates the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.
You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:
Insert a character
Delete a character
Replace a character_

How to run:
npm start -- wordone wordtwo

Your task is to improve readability of the code wherever it's possible and highlight any performance issues if any.

Here is a list of points:
- Look at the current algorithm implementation and propose a way(s) to improve it (no coding needed here)
- Refactor code (feel free to change anything)
- Add tests. For testing purposes you can add any testing library you want.
